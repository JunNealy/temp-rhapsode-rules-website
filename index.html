    <h1>Basic Rules</h1>

    <h2>Rolling Mechanics</h2>
    <p>
      When engaging in a risky action, you will roll a number of six-sided dice
      (<code>xD6</code>). The number of dice rolled is determined by your level
      in the relevant skill and any bonus dice granted by equipment,
      circumstances, or aid from another player.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1-3 counts as a <strong>MISS</strong></li>
      <li>4 or 5 counts as 1 <strong>HIT</strong></li>
      <li>6 counts as 2 <strong>HITS</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Game Master assigns a <strong>TARGET NUMBER</strong> from 1 to 6. This
      number is equal to the number of HITS needed to succeed in the action.
    </p>
    <p>
      After rolling, count your HITS and MISSES and compare them against the
      TARGET NUMBER to determine the degree to which the action succeeds or
      fails:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>CRITICAL SUCCESS:</strong> If you roll 2 or more sixes, you
        succeed critically achieving your aims and gaining an additional
        benefit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>SUCCESS:</strong> If your total hits are equal to or greater
        than the target number you succeed at the action.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>PARTIAL SUCCESS:</strong> If your total hits are equal to one
        half the target number rounded up, you partially succeed, achieving some
        or all of your action with a consequence or complication.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>FAILURE:</strong> If your total hits are lower than one half the
        target number, your action fails.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>CATASTROPHE:</strong> If you failed and rolled 2 or more 1s,
        something goes terribly wrong.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Stakes</h2>
    <p>
      Every action has <strong>STAKES</strong>, representing the potential risks
      and rewards of the action. The GM sets the STAKES before rolling, based on
      the action's aim and the current circumstances.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>LOW RISK:</strong> Safe action, mild consequences, low reward.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>MODERATE RISK:</strong> Balanced risk and reward; failure may
        still be manageable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>HIGH RISK:</strong> Extreme risk; high reward, but failure may
        be catastrophic.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Raising the Stakes</h3>
    <p>
      You may <strong>RAISE THE STAKES</strong> before rolling, increasing the
      risk tier and the TARGET NUMBER by +1. Raising the stakes does not grant
      additional dice but increases both reward and consequences.
    </p>

    <h2>Sway</h2>
    <p>
      All players start each episode with 0 SWAY and can have a maximum of 3.
      Excess SWAY is wasted.
    </p>
    <p>You gain +1 SWAY in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you fail a roll</li>
      <li>When you invoke your Shadow</li>
      <li>
        At the GM’s discretion for exceptional roleplaying or dramatic choices
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Flourish</h2>
    <p>
      Before rolling, you may invoke a <strong>FACET</strong>—your own or one
      present in the scene:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spend 1 SWAY to add +1d6 to your roll.</li>
      <li>Spend 2 SWAY to add +1d6 to an ally’s roll.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Shadow</h2>
    <p>Before rolling, you may invoke a Facet to complicate your action:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gain 1 SWAY and subtract 1d6 from your own roll.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Special Abilities</h2>
    <p>
      Special abilities are unique ways to interact with the world. Usage limits
      are specified per ability.
    </p>

    <h2>Character Turns</h2>
    <p>During your turn, you may:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make one Move: Overcome, Discern, or Establish</li>
      <li>Narratively move or position yourself</li>
      <li>Speak freely outside of core Moves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Actions</h2>
    <p>
      Actions are how your character engages with uncertain outcomes. You may
      take one action per turn:
    </p>

    <h3>Overcome</h3>
    <p>Attempt to overcome an obstacle, opponent, or internal struggle.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use when something opposes your intent</li>
      <li>Failure should create meaningful consequences</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Discern</h3>
    <p>Ask the GM questions to uncover truths about the current situation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use when understanding the scene could change your choices</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Establish</h3>
    <p>
      Alter the fiction by introducing meaningful new details, advantages, or
      complications.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use when you want to assert narrative agency</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Facets</h2>
    <p>
      Facets are short, evocative descriptions of characters, scenes, or the
      world. They can influence actions and outcomes.
    </p>

    <h2>Harm</h2>
    <p>
      Represents physical or psychological consequences. Harm can be highlighted
